So, any sites already in play won’t get the extra mana until the start of your next turn. But, if you play Abundance and then play a site into Abundance’s area of effect, the newly played site will generate extra mana immediately. Also, if you start your turn with a site in Abundance, and then during your Main Phase the site is no longer in Abundance (e.g. Cloud City moving away, Scorched Earth, etc.), you don’t lose the mana that you gained during your Start Phase.",

Note that the killer must be a unit, but multiple units can share credit for a kill, if they both share the same priority. For example, Grapple Shot will only give credit to the ally who strikes, not the spellcaster, since priority 1 is higher.

That means it’s mostly unaffected by things that normally affect units - a burrowed Root Spider doesn’t disable it, a nearby House Arn Bannerman doesn’t buff it, and Entangle Terrain doesn’t Immobilize it, etc. Furthermore, the unit that Free City is fighting can’t actually strike Free City! Units can only strike other units, and Free City is not a unit. Therefore, the unit that Free City is fighting does not strike Free City at all.

Then, we start resolving those steps. If Mariner's Curse is on site B, once the unit being dragged reaches site B, it will be submerged, and live. Then the game tries to resolve Move B (surface) -> C (surface), which fails, since the unit isn't on the surface of site B anymore. Thus, there's no strike from Grapple Shot since it didn't reach the hit unit's location.",
